setwd("C:/BITS files/") means that the files that you will use all need to be under the C drive in a folder called BITS 
files. You may have as many subfolders within a given folder as long as they are all indexed correctly. That is, if it is within a subfolder called tutorial inside BITS files, you will say "C:/BITS files/tutorial"
