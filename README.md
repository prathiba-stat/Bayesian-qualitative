# Bayesian-rate-ratio
Install R version 3.5.3 or above for this package to work.
Bayesian rate ratio effect sizes for count data

Download all R files and save them to a single directory. This will be your working directory.

Start by installing R, Rstudio, and JAGS from the internet.
You will also need to install a few more packages such as runjags,
rjags, and ggplot2.The rest of the programs that need to be sourced are
automatically programmed in the main file called Rate ratio-ABAB.R

Use RStudio as your program to call R and JAGS

The working directory in R used forward slash. For example
setwd("C:/BITS files/") means that the files that you will use all need to be under the C drive in a folder called BITS 
files. You may have as many subfolders within a given folder as long as they are all indexed correctly. That is, if it is within a subfolder called tutorial inside BITS files, you will say "C:/BITS files/tutorial"

Any text that comes after # on a line is a comment and will not be executed. This is used to help you understand the script.

In plots_left_side.R, plots_right_side.R and Rate ratio-ABAB.R files, #set working directory and remove the hashtag sign from line 2 

Open Rate ratio-ABAB.R and work your way through the file by highlighting each line with your mouse and clicking on "Run" in the browser or ctrl+R
